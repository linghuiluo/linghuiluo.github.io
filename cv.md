I am also a maintainer of the Java optimization framework---Soot and led the development of a brand new version of Soot over two years. In addition to research and engineering, I also assisted in teaching several courses held by our research group in area of both security in software engineering and program analysis.
   - Advised by [Prof. Eric Bodden](https://www.bodden.de/)
- **Applied Scientist I (Intern)**, Sep. 2020 - Jan. 2021, Internship in team CodeGuru at Amazon Web Services, Remote, Germany.  
  - The internship was planned to happen in New York. Due to COVID-19, I worked remotely with the team AWS CodeGuru in the US from Germany. During the internship, I worked on exploring the possibility of supporting IDE integration for cloud-based Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools. I built a research prototype and
conducted user studies with software developers at AWS. A research paper from this work was published at the ESEC/FSE conference 2021.
  - Advised by [Dr. Martin Schäf](https://www.martinschaef.de/) 
- **Research Intern**, Jan. 2019 – Feb. 2019, Research in collaboration with [Dr. Julian Dolby](https://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view.php?person=us-dolby) at IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center, New York, USA. 
  - The internship was planned as a research collaboration, invited by Dr. Dolby from IBM research. During the internship, I worked on design and development of the MagpieBridge
framework for integrating static analyses into IDEs and Editors. A research paper from this work was published at the ECOOP conference 2019. MagpieBridge is an open-source project and distributed on Maven Central, used by multiple research and commercial projects.
  - Advised by [Dr. Julian Dolby](https://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view.php?person=us-dolby)
- **Student Assistant**, Feb. 2015 – Mar. 2017, Research group Theory of Distributed System, Paderborn University, Paderborn, Germany.
  - I designed and developed a simulator in Java for evaluating and visualizing various distributed algorithms in area of self-stabilization, which is a concept of fault-tolerance in distributed systems. I also completed my master thesis in this area and published the work at the IPDPS conference 2019. 
  - Advised by [Dr. Thim Strothmann](https://www.uni-paderborn.de/en/person/11319/) 
- **Student Assistant**, Nov. 2013 – Jan. 2015, Wincor Nixdorf, Paderborn, Germany.
