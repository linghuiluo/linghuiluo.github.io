## Biography 

>"The usage of Static Application Security Testing (SAST) Tools should become an industrial
convention in secure software development. However, we need to
create usable tools at first."

Dr. Linghui Luo is an Applied Scientist at Amazon Web Services. Her research interests include program analysis with a security focus, empirical software engineering and usable security. She is mostly interested in designing and tuning static analysis tools based on the empirical data from the real world and needs of software developers. 

Prior to Amazon, Dr. Luo worked as a research associate in the [Secure Software Engineering Group](https://www.hni.uni-paderborn.de/en/software-engineering) at Paderborn University from 2017 to 2021. She received her PhD degree from Paderborn University in 2021 and was advised by [Prof. Eric Bodden](https://www.bodden.de). Her PhD resarch was awarded both nationally and internationally: She won the [silver medal in the ACM Student Research Competition at the ESEC/FSE Conference 2021](https://src.acm.org/winners/2022) and is the winner of the [Ernst Denert Software Engineering Award 2021](https://fb-swt.gi.de/weiteres/ernst-denert-se-preis/bisherige-preistraeger).
