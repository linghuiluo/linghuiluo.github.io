## Biography 

>"The usage of Static Application Security Testing (SAST) Tools should become an industrial
convention in secure software development. However, we need to
create usable tools at first."

Dr. Linghui Luo is an [applied scientist](https://www.amazon.science/author/linghui-luo) at Amazon Web Services, specializing in program analysis with a focus on security, as well as empirical software engineering and usable security. She has a proven track record of designing and implementing static analysis tools based on real-world data and the needs of software developers. Her research has been widely recognized in the Software Engineering field, including winning the [Ernst Denert Software Engineering Award 2021](https://fb-swt.gi.de/weiteres/ernst-denert-se-preis/bisherige-preistraeger) and the silver medal in the [ACM Student Research Competition at the ESEC/FSE Conference 2021](https://src.acm.org/winners/2022).

Before joining Amazon, Dr. Luo was a research associate in the Secure Software Engineering Group at Paderborn University. She received her PhD from Paderborn University in 2021, with distinction, under the advisement of [Prof. Eric Bodden](https://www.bodden.de).
