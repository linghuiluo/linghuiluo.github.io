## Biography 

>"The usage of Static Application Security Testing (SAST) Tools should become an industrial
convention in secure software development. However, we need to
create usable tools at first."

Linghui Luo (ÁΩóÁÅµÊÖß) is a PhD candidate advised by [Prof. Eric Bodden](https://www.bodden.de/). She works as a research associate in the [Secure Software Engineering Group](https://www.hni.uni-paderborn.de/en/software-engineering) at Paderborn University since July 2017. Her research interests include program analysis (mainly [Taint Analysis](taintanalysis.md) for Java and Android applications) with a security focus, empirical software engineering and usable security & privacy. She is mostly interested in designing and tuning static analysis tools based on the needs of software developers and empirical data from the real world. 
She believes Open Source is the future and contributes to the open source community. She is the creator of [MagpieBridge](https://github.com/MagpieBridge/MagpieBridge) and one of the main contributers of the [FutureSoot](http://soot-oss.github.io/soot/future-soot/) project.

<p>üì¢ My PhD defense is scheduled on on Oct. 27, 2021.</p>

## Life Outside of Work
Together with her husband Linghui keeps three beloved pets: a dog (Java), a cat (Alan) and a black cat (Hacker).
She loves to spend her time with her pets and do sports such as bouldering and swimming (before COVID-19). 
She also enjoys music and plays the cello.
